# Method Chaining

## Challenge 1

### Instructions:

Download **Method-Chaining-Sample-Code-master.zip** from the lesson folder and unzip. Create a cloud 9 workspace and use *File, Upload Local Files* to import the lesson files from the Sample-site folder within the Method-Chaining-Sample-Code-master folder.

Make changes to the script.js file for the jQuery code. Apply the following behavior to the blue button in the button.html file:

* Create a CSS class (makeRed, add it to style.css) which gives the Button a red color, apply this class to the button Element (add to class attribute in the html).
* Create another class (makeBorder, add it to style.css) which gives the Button a border of 2px, do not apply to the HTML.
* On mouseenter remove the red class and add the border class.
* On mouseleave reverse the above.
* Use method chaining to achieve the above.

## Challenge 2

### Instructions:

When the button is clicked, make the paragraph slide up. When clicked again, make it slide down. This effect is a real-world example of how jQuery can be used on a button or a menu item.

## Challange 3

### Instructions:

Now try hide() / show() and fadeIn() / fadeOut() on button click. Create a second button and paragraph. Run the code and click on the buttons.

You will notice that both buttons perform the same action on both paragraphs. Even if you mouse over one button, both are highlighted (if you still have the mouseover code). Why? Because for now, our jQuery code says so.
